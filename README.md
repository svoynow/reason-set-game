A version of the card game Set. Written as an exercise in learing ReasonML / ReasonReact. Still a WIP. Eventually I want to add a websocket backend for multiplayer (probably using Elixir/Phoenix)

It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), using [reason-scripts](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-scripts)

## Installation

If you don't already have a working ReasonML development environment, first do:

```
npm install -g bs-platform
npm install -g reason-cli
```

Otherwise, just:

```
git clone https://github.com/svoynow/reason-set-game
yarn install
yarn start
```

You probably need to have reasonably recent versions of node/npm/yarn. I was using yarn 1.7.0, npm 6.1.0 and node 10.4.0 during development.
